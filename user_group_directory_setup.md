# User and Group Management with Permissions on RHEL


## Step 1: Create Users

Create four users: `user1`, `user2`, `acc1`, `acc2`.

```bash
 useradd user1
 useradd user2
 useradd acc1
 useradd acc2
```

### 🔑 Set Password for User
```bash
passwd user1
```
> `Note:` Do same for all other user's 

---

## 👪 Step 2: Create Groups

Create two groups: `students` and `office`.

```bash
 groupadd students
 groupadd office
```

---

## ➕ Step 3: Add Users to Groups

Add `user1` and `user2` to the `students` group:

```bash
 usermod -aG students user1
 usermod -aG students user2
```

Add `acc1` and `acc2` to the `office` group:

```bash
 usermod -aG office acc1
 usermod -aG office acc2
```

To verify 
```bash
id user1
id acc1
```

---

## 📁 Step 4: Create Group Directories

Create directories for each group:

```bash
 mkdir /students
 mkdir /office
```

Check Existing Permision and Ownership
```bash
ls -l
```

---

## 🔐 Step 5: Assign Group Ownership

Assign group ownership of each directory:

```bash
 chown :students /students
 chown :office /office
```

Check Ownership
```bash
ls -l
```

---

## 🔐 File and Directory Permissions

### 📄 Permission Types

| Symbol | Meaning         |
|--------|------------------|
| r      | Read             |
| w      | Write            |
| x      | Execute          |
| -      | No permission    |

### 👥 Ownership Structure
```bash
-rwxr-xr-- 1 owner group filename
```

- Owner: `rwx`
- Group: `r-x`
- Others: `r--`

---

### 🔄 Change Ownership
```bash
sudo chown newowner:newgroup filename
```

---

### ✏️ Change Permissions

#### Numeric Format
```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

| Number | Permission |
|--------|------------|
| 7      | rwx        |
| 6      | rw-        |
| 5      | r-x        |
| 4      | r--        |
| 3      | -wx        |
| 2      | -w-        |
| 1      | --x        |
| 0      | ---        |


## ✏️ Step 6: Set Directory Permissions

Give read/write/execute access to group members only:

```bash
 chmod 770 /students
 chmod 770 /office
```

This means:
- Owner: full access
- Group: full access
- Others: no access

---

## 📌 Step 7: Set Sticky Bit (optional)

Set the **sticky bit** to prevent users from deleting each other’s files within the shared directory.

```bash
 chmod +t /students
 chmod +t /office
```

Now only file **owners** and **root** can delete files inside those directories.

---

## 🧪 Step 8: Verify Permissions

```bash
ls -ld /students /office
```

Expected output:
```
drwxrwx--T 2 root students 4096 ... /students
drwxrwx--T 2 root office   4096 ... /office
```

### ❌ Delete a User
```bash
userdel user1
```

To remove user home directory as well:
```bash
userdel -r user1
```

### 🔍 View User Groups
```bash
groups username
```

### ❌ Delete a Group
```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```
