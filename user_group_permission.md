# User and Group & Permissions Management 

## Step 1: Create Users
Create four users: `user1`, `user2`, `acc1`, `acc2`.

```bash
useradd user1
useradd user2
useradd acc1
useradd acc2
````

ðŸ”‘ **Set Password for Users**

```bash
passwd user1
```

(Note: Do the same for all other users.)

## Step 2: Create Groups

Create two groups: `students` and `office`.

```bash
groupadd students
groupadd office
```

## Step 3: Add Users to Groups

Add `user1` and `user2` to the `students` group:

```bash
usermod -aG students user1
usermod -aG students user2
```

Add `acc1` and `acc2` to the `office` group:

```bash
usermod -aG office acc1
usermod -aG office acc2
```

### To verify:

```bash
id user1
id acc1
```

## Step 4: Create Group Directories

Create directories for each group:

```bash
mkdir /students
mkdir /office
```

### Check Existing Permissions and Ownership:

```bash
ls -l
```

## Step 5: Assign Group Ownership

Assign group ownership of each directory:

```bash
chown :students /students
chown :office /office
```

### Check Ownership:

```bash
ls -l
```

## File and Directory Permissions

### Permission Types

| Symbol | Meaning       |
| ------ | ------------- |
| r      | Read          |
| w      | Write         |
| x      | Execute       |
| -      | No permission |

### Ownership Structure

Example: `-rwxr-xr-- 1 owner group filename`

* **Owner:** `rwx`
* **Group:** `r-x`
* **Others:** `r--`

### Change Ownership

```bash
sudo chown newowner:newgroup filename
```

### Change Permissions (Numeric Format)

```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

| Number | Permission |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 7      | rwx        |
| 6      | rw-        |
| 5      | r-x        |
| 4      | r--        |
| 3      | -wx        |
| 2      | -w-        |
| 1      | --x        |
| 0      | ---        |

## Step 6: Set Directory Permissions

Give read/write/execute access to group members only:

```bash
chmod 770 /students
chmod 770 /office
```

This means:

* **Owner:** Full access
* **Group:** Full access
* **Others:** No access

## Step 7: Set Sticky Bit (Optional)

Set the sticky bit to prevent users from deleting each otherâ€™s files within the shared directory.

```bash
chmod +t /students
chmod +t /office
```

Now only file owners and root can delete files inside those directories.

## Step 8: Verify Permissions

```bash
ls -ld /students /office
```

### Expected output:

```bash
drwxrwx--T 2 root students 4096 ... /students
drwxrwx--T 2 root office   4096 ... /office
```

## Delete a User

```bash
userdel user1
```

To remove the user's home directory as well:

```bash
userdel -r user1
```

## View User Groups

```bash
groups username
```

## Delete a Group

```bash
sudo groupdel groupname
```
